## Example

This example exists only for demonstration of syntax purposes and does very few things:
- creates collection `std3` with validator that ensures, that every document inserted has a field `name` and it's type is `string`
- inserts document in `std3`
- creates collection `std4` with validator that ensures, that every document inserted has a field `name` and it's type is `string`
- inserts document in `std4`
